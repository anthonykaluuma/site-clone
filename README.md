# Site Clone
This project serves as an improved instruction manual over my [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K21WClcKo4g) on how to clone a Website and host it with Firebase Hosting. The instructions in my video are heavily *nix operating system focused, whereas these instructions cater to Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Differences between the instructions here and the video
-These instructions cater to Windows, Mac, and Linux rather than *nix systems alone.
-Here we use a NPM deployment script which is operating system agnositc, rather than a bash script (like in my video).


### Step 1: Install dependencies

#### Windows
1. Open up a command prompt as administrator
